# Fez Glyph Translator

This is a very simple translator between English and Zuish alphabets for the video game Fez.

## Background
Originally I created this as a web project, likely between 2010-2012 (I cannot remember). I always thought a mobile version would be pretty nice/handy when playing the game Fez. As practice in learning to work with Expo/React Native, I decided to recreate it as a mobile app finally achieving my dreams. Now I can die happy.

## Outstanding Items
* Adding numerals to translation
* (Unlikley) Adding instant screen to translation via camera
